# Facies simulation using GANs based on a single training image

## Description

This code was modified from https://github.com/tamarott/SinGAN.
2D Lena river delta and 3D Descalvado aquifer analog models are considered as training image.
The random realizations are further calibrated to observed data using gradual deformation method.
